# DO NOT CHANGE THIS BECAUSE THIS IS THE CONFIG FOR THE SECOND EXPERIMENT, BUILD ANOTHER ONE

# This experiment was done by training on the whole training set.
# All the features, but normalized to zero mean and unit variance.
# Cross-validation.
# Regularized logistic regression.
# Accuracy 0.75 and F1 score 0.622 on the test set.
