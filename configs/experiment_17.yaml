# DO NOT CHANGE THIS BECAUSE THIS IS THE CONFIG FOR THE 17TH EXPERIMENT (COMPARABLE WITH 14), BUILD ANOTHER ONE

# This experiment was done by training on the whole training set.
# All the features + 3 degree polynomial and SQUARE ROOT features, but standardized to zero mean and unit variance.
# Replaced all -999 values with feature-wise median !!!.
# Max_iters was increased to 20000 !!!!! - THIS DID NOT IMPROVE THE MODEL AT ALL
# Cross validation was run.
# Removed outliers at training, before replacing values of -999.
# Accuracy 0.808 and F1 score 0.701 on the test set.
