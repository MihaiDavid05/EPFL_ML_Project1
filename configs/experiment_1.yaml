# DO NOT CHANGE THIS BECAUSE THIS IS THE CONFIG FOR THE FIRST EXPERIMENT, BUILD ANOTHER ONE

# This experiment was done by training on an arbitrary 80% of the training set and not the whole training set by using
# split_data() function.
# All the features, but standardized to zero mean and unit variance.
# Simple logistic regression.
# Accuracy 0.75 and F1 score 0.624 on the test set.

# Parameters

# step_size
gamma: 0.5
# number of steps to run
max_iters: 1000
# regularization parameter
lambda: null
# ratio split
ratio: 0.8
# Enable cross validation
cross_val: False
# Number of folds for cross-validation
kfold: null
# Whether to build polynomial features or not
build_poly: False
# Degrees for polynomial features
degree: null
# Wheather to multiply each column with each column and expand features
multiply_each: False
# Replace -999 values with specified value, this can take 'zero', 'mean' or null
replace_with: null
