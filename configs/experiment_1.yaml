# DO NOT CHANGE THIS BECAUSE THIS IS THE CONFIG FOR THE FIRST EXPERIMENT, BUILD ANOTHER ONE

# This experiment was done by training on an arbitrary 80% of the training set and not the whole training set by using
# split_data() function.
# All the features, but standardized to zero mean and unit variance.
# Simple logistic regression.
# Accuracy 0.75 and F1 score 0.624 on the test set.
