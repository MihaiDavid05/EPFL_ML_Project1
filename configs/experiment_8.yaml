# COMPARABLE WITH 7, BUT ONLY ADDED multiply_each=True

# This experiment was done by training on the whole training set.
# All the features + 3 degree polynomial, but standardized to zero mean and unit variance.
# Replaced all -999 values with feature-wise mean.
# Max_iters was increased to 10000.
# Tried multiply_each=True - BUT NOT OK
# Accuracy ? and F1 score ? on the test set.
